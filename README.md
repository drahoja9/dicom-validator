# dcm-spec-tools
___

*dcm-spec-tools* is planned to be a collection of simple pure python command line tools.
The input for the tools shall be taken from the DICOM standard in docbook format
as provided by [ACR NEMA] (http://medical.nema.org/).
A simple reader shall extract the needed information and optionally write it in json format.
Currently this is in the state of a toy project and not usable.
[pydicom] (https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom) will be used to read/parse DICOM files.
